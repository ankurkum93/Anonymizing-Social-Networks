# Data Protection and Privacy

This is an academic Project in which I have used different techniques for Graph anonymization and why is it important.

There are different ways of anonymization that I have used are Naive anonymization and Random pertubration.
The conclusion can be better seen in the presentation that I have prepared using Prezi.
